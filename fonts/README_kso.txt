Kanji Stroke Order Font v4.004
==============================

   Released 9 September 2020
   ======================

   Latest version at: https://www.nihilist.org.uk

INTRODUCTION
This font provides an easy way to view stroke order diagrams for over 6500
kanji, over 180 kana symbols, the Latin characters and quite a few other
symbols. I have also used it as a dumping ground for my own character
creation doodles.

My hope is that this font will assist people who are learning kanji. I
also hope it will help teachers of Japanese in the preparation of
classroom material. Beware that Japanese stroke order can differ from the
stroke order used in other languages that use Chinese characters.

HOW TO INSTALL AND USE THIS FONT
Install this font as you would any other TrueType font. In the parts of
your document where you want the kanji to be annotated with stroke order
numbers simply set your document's font to KanjiStrokeOrders. You will
need to set the size of the font to be large to allow the stroke order
numbers to show up: 100pt seems to be the minimum usable size.

As of version v4.003, KSOF works with Microsoft Word on Macintosh as well
as with Microsoft Word for Windows. This was the most significant change
from v4.001 to v4.002.

If you use the Anki flashcard program then the Anki website includes some
instructions on using custom fonts (such as KSOF) with that package. One
user reported needing to rename the font filename to remove the version
number to get it to work with AnkiDroid.

I have had one report from the field of Mac OS X 10.4.11 complaining about
missing OpenType data, although this does not happen with OS X 10.5. I am
told that KSOF works fine on OS X 10.4.11 if you ignore the warning, so it's
nothing to worry about. Thanks are due to Phil for reporting this.

INTEGRATION WITH JWPCE
This font enables you to view kanji stroke orders in JWPce. Set the "Big
Kanji Font" to KanjiStrokeOrders in the Options dialog. Some kanji stroke
order diagrams might show a different stroke count to that reported by
JWPce in the same kanji information window. This is because some kanji
have more than one valid stroke count.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION
I created this font by using the Batik library to convert the AAAA and
Wadoku projects' SVG files into high-resolution PNG images. I turned these
into a font using Fontforge. I use Fontforge for ongoing development.

The Kanji Stroke Order Font includes all the characters defined by JIS X
0208:1997, plus many more.

EXAMPLES
Included in this archive are two examples of the use of this font with popular
office software. They are in PDF format.

CORRECTIONS
As the changelog below shows, users have found quite a few errors in the
stroke orders diagrams. There are probably more. If you find any errors
please let me know by email: mail |at| nihilist (dot) org (dot) uk. You
can expect your changes to appear once enough fixes have accumulated to
make a new release worthwhile. When reporting an error, please tell me
what you think is wrong with the kanji and provide a link to a reference
if possible.

While working on this font I was interested to find that references
generally considered to be authoratitive sometimes disagree on stroke
order and even stroke count. U+53CE 収 and U+6E1B 減 are examples of
kanji that vary in documented stroke order. Furthermore, the
well-respected reference Kanjidic lists hundreds of kanji with multiple
valid stroke counts. Appendix E of the Kanjidic documentation discusses
stroke counts in detail. If you are not sure whether a character needs
correcting please let me know anyway so I can investigate. My primary
reference is http://kakijun.jp/.

OPENTYPE FEATURES
+smcp Small capitals for a-z. For example, in XeTeX use
      \font\smallcaps="KanjiStrokeOrders:+smcp" at 10pt
+utop Thomas More's Utopian characters plus the product integral symbol.
      The lowercase Latin characters map to their Utopian counterparts and z
      maps to the product integral symbol. Note that Thomas More wrote
      "Utopia" in Latin and, as such, this range of characters does not
      include the letters j, u, w or z (but z maps to the product integral
      symbol).
+spec The Sinclair ZX spectrum block graphics characters. These originally
      occupied the range 0x80 to 0x8F in the Sinclair ZX Spectrum character
      set. The symbol @ maps to the blank block and the letters A to O
      correspond to the non-blank block graphics. Why @? Because in the ZX
      Spectrum character set @ was 0x40 and A-O were 0x41-0x4F.

2011/03/29  2.016 Added Thomas More's Utopian characters (see +utop above) at
                  U+F800 to U+F818. Added Product Integral symbol (see +utop
                  above) at U+F919. Added Sinclair ZX Spectrum block graphics
                  at U+F7F0 to U+F7FF. Added radicals at U+91D2, U+2ECA, U+8A01,
                  U+2EB6, U+2EAA, U+2EB7, U+2EA7, U+2EBB, U+7529, U+9763,
                  U+2EBC. Improved readability of U+9751. Adding missing character
                  glyph at U+0000.
2010/10/05  2.015 Removed one stroke from U+6357, notionally in compliance with
                  JIS X 0213 and the Unicode reference table but actually
                  because someone suggested it. There are many other characters
                  in KSOF that don't match JIS X 0213 but I don't intend to
                  change those; I made an exception for U+6357 because it's slated
                  to become a Joyo kanji. Corrected U+6E90, U+646F, U+7D68,
                  U+8650, U+6F5F, U+6557, U+8FB6 (controversial: it is unclear
                  whether this radical has 3 or 4 strokes). Added the following
                  extra radicals thanks to the generous help of Durand D'souza:
                  U+722B, U+2E99 (an unusual radical), U+6236, U+4E5A, U+725C,
                  U+2F21, U+8980, U+72AD, U+9751, U+6C35, U+9578, U+2EAE,
                  U+8FB5, U+5C23, U+5DDC, U+4E61, U+6237, U+6B7A, U+7CF9, U+8080.
                  Corrected U+718A. Added U+FA35 (variant of U+5351). Corrected
                  U+62C9. Shortened first stroke of U+308A. Shortened U+30FC.

                  common version of cliff radical. Clarified U+6163. Corrected
                  U+7CA5, U+8258, U+5396
2008/12/29  2.012 Corrected U+544E, U+9D28, U+6388, U+5D8B
2008/10/01  2.011 Corrected U+9280, U+8607, U+6089, U+6955, U+7566, U+79A6,
                  U+7B08, U+9803, U+86E4, U+88DF. Clarified U+8511.
2008/07/17  2.010 Corrected U+74DC, U+9CE9, U+79BD, U+8DA8, U+82BB, U+50FB,
                  U+4FB6, U+586B, U+5835, U+5C3B, U+63F7, U+64E2. Clarified
                  U+50AD. Thanks once again to Scott Krogh.
2008/01/02: 2.009 Corrected U+76FE, U+8846, U+885B, U+5171. Thanks to Aaron
                  and Scott Krogh for spotting these.

                  U+6A8E, U+6A23, U+9244, U+85AC, U+7CDE. Merged in the
                  Choumei v1.10 glyphs, thus providing KanjiStrokeOrders with
                  all the JIS 0208 characters. Added support for small caps.

                  U+821B, U+74F1, U+5178, U+82E1, U+5BC3, U+9B42, U+6F11,
                  U+5E43, U+91D0, U+74F8, U+74EE, U+74F0, U+74F7, U+7513,

                  U+6A8E, U+9B51, U+7DFB. Removed glyph list and moved &, ', (,
                  ) and * into their correct encoding slots. Correction from
                  Aaron: U+6E1B.
2008/02/29: 2.006 Corrections from Aaron: U+5EA7, U+51F8. Fixed

                  U+5EFB, U+5EB6, U+534A, U+7554, U+754F, U+5224, U+5C04,
                  U+8DEF, U+96A3, U+9F62, U+5B9B, U+6028, U+990A, U+8A55.
                  Replaced Tuffy glyphs with those from Choumei, thus making
                  the font more consistent in appearence. Added a list of
                  glyphs provided by the font.
2008/01/14: 2.004 Fixed bugs in U+5BA2, U+843D, U+539F, U+9ED2, U+9B5A, U+5B89,

                  more kanji, the Latin alphabet, punctuation and some other
                  symbols. This used a fresh set of SVG data from Ulrich Apel.

2006/10/27: 1.0   Initial revision

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Almost all the work for this font was done by the AAAA and Wadoku projects
under the supervision of Ulrich Apel. I just had the idea of turning the
SVG data into a font and did so. Thanks are due to Scott, Aaron, Paul,
Jeremy, Mifune-san, Gerrit, Brian, Noli, William, Alex, Jerome, Neale,
Nicolas, Przemyslaw, Piotrek, James, Tobias, Jakob, Edgar, Olga, Reinaert,
Mr. Yoon, Meirav, Alfredo, Josh, Sebastian, Samuli, Eugene, Jeff, Gerard,
Inoue-san, Ahmed, Grant, Takao-san, Michael, Kitamura-san, Shibuya-san,
Minh and Herouth for reporting errors in the stroke order data and making
suggestions for improvements. I have fixed all these errors in the current
version. Thanks also to Durand D'souza for doing the background research
on the Kanji radicals I added in version 2.015.

An especially big thank you is due to Toshirō-san, who sent me corrections
for literally hundreds of characters for the V4.0 release.

Please keep the feedback coming; I always welcome corrections and suggestions.
